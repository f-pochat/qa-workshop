# Challenge

End-2-End Automation Testing Challenge
For the End-2-End Automation testing challenge, you will automate test cases for the provided website below.

https://practice.automationtesting.in/

## Guidelines
### Design Pattern:
Page Object Model

**Page Object Files**
Each page or component of the application should be separated into its own file containing locators and functions for that page.

**Test Data Files**
It is a JSON file from which data is retrieved for the tests.

**Test Files**
Test files are separated by functionalities and sections of the app, not by page.
A test can consume page objects from different files.

### Test Structure:
You can create the test structure as you see fit, considering code readability and report readability. You can use the test.step function for this.

### Perks:

Configurations from the .config file will be considered to enhance the execution of your tests, reliability, coverage, and traceability.

## Test Cases:

The test cases are available at this link: https://practice.automationtesting.in/test-cases/

Automate a single test case for each section **HOME PAGE, MY ACCOUNT - LOGIN, MY ACCOUNT - REGISTRATION, SHOP, MY ACCOUNT)**

**TOTAL: 5** Automated tests should be in the suite.

The complexity level of the chosen tests will be taken into account.
